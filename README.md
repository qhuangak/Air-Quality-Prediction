# Air-Quality-Prediction
This is the 5002 data mining independent project

This is 5002 Data Mining Project, in this project, I need to predict the 35 stationsâ€™ pollution level of PM2.5, PM10, O3 from 2018-5-1 to 2018-5-2 in Beijing, China, by the air quality data and weather data from 2017-1-1 to 2018-4-30. There are total 48 hours for each station. In this project, I use Python code on Spyder of Anaconda. 

Before reading this project, you should read the report.pdf at first.

And the data of this project is stored in the code.py.
